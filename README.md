# Just a Learning Kernel
This is just a simple kernel I am writing over the summer with the objective of learning a bit more on how OS's work and to also improve my coding skills.

# Objectives
I hope to at least get the kernel to do the following:
* File System and VFS implementation.
* Multitasking.
* Loading an ELF program.

I am not making this kernel to be portable nor to replace Linux or become something, I am just doing it with the objective of learning.
